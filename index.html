          Crowley gained widespread notoriety during his lifetime, being a
          recreational drug user, bisexual, and an individualist social critic.
          Crowley has remained a highly influential figure over Western
          esotericism and the counterculture of the 1960s, and continues to be
          considered a prophet in Thelema. He is the subject of various
          biographies and academic studies.
